# Wire Protocol Reference

Transport: WebSocket text frames. One packet per frame. No trailing `\n`.

Every packet starts with a single-character type prefix and a space, then the
body. Bodies are tab-separated where they have multiple fields.

## Packet types

| Prefix | Type      | Use                                                       |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `c`    | COMMAND   | Control frames (ping/pong, new, id, end, etc.)            |
| `d`    | DATA      | Game logic. Carries a per-direction sequence number.       |
| `s`    | STRING    | Telemetry. Rare. Currently unused inbound.                 |
| `h`    | HEADER    | Initial handshake (`h 1`) sent by server on connect.       |

DATA packets are the only ones with sequence numbers. Both directions count
independently (server's outbound seq starts at 0, client's outbound seq starts
at 0). A seq mismatch closes the connection — see `Connection.handleRawMessage`.

## Connect handshake

On WebSocket open the server sends three frames immediately:
```
h 1
c crt 250
c ctr
```

Then the client drives login. The handshake-banner values aren't checked by
us (Java reads them) but we send them verbatim for compatibility.

## Login flow

```
client → c new
server → c id <int>            (assigned player id, monotonic)
client → d 0 version<TAB>35    (35 = GOLF gametype version)
server → d 0 status<TAB>login
client → d 1 language<TAB>en   (en|fi|sv — server records, no reply)
client → d 2 logintype<TAB>nr  (nr = guest; the only one we implement)
server → d 1 status<TAB>login  (yes, twice — Java oddity)
client → d 3 nick<TAB>{name}   (PORT EXTENSION — optional; if omitted or
                                rejected, server falls back to a random
                                `~anonym-` placeholder)
client → d 4 login
server → d 2 basicinfo<TAB>t<TAB>0<TAB>t<TAB>t
server → d 3 status<TAB>lobbyselect<TAB>300
```

After this the client is at the lobby-select screen.

## Lobby select

Polled every 5s by the lobbyselect panel for live counts:
```
client → d N lobbyselect<TAB>rnop
server → d K lobbyselect<TAB>nop<TAB>{single}<TAB>{dual}<TAB>{multi}
```

To enter a lobby:
```
client → d N lobbyselect<TAB>select<TAB>{1|2|x}[<TAB>h]   (h = chat-hidden)
server → d K status<TAB>lobby<TAB>{1|2|x}[h]
server → d K+1 lobby<TAB>users[<TAB>{playerString}...]    (player list)
server → d K+2 lobby<TAB>ownjoin<TAB>{playerString}        (self)
server → d K+3 lobby<TAB>tagcounts<TAB>{all}<TAB>{c1}..{c6}  (port-extension)
```

Multi lobbies additionally get the game list right after `users`:
```
server → d K lobby<TAB>gamelist<TAB>full<TAB>{count}<TAB>{game0_f0}<TAB>...<TAB>{gameN_f14}
```

## Player string

`Player.toString()` produces a caret-separated 6-tuple, prefixed with `3:`:
```
3:{nick}^{flags}^{ranking}^{lang}^{profileUrl|-}^{avatarUrl|-}
```

`flags` is one of `r`, `v`, `s`, `n` (registered/vip/sheriff/no-challenges)
or `w` if none apply.

## Game string (15 fields)

Used in `lobby gamelist add/change` and friends. Tab-separated:
```
{id}<TAB>{name}<TAB>{passworded(t/f)}<TAB>{perms}<TAB>{numPlayers}<TAB>-1
<TAB>{numTracks}<TAB>{trackType}<TAB>{maxStrokes}<TAB>{strokeTimeout}
<TAB>{waterEvent}<TAB>{collision}<TAB>{trackScoring}<TAB>{trackScoringEnd}
<TAB>{currentPlayers}
```

`-1` is a placeholder slot from the original Java. `trackType` is the
category id (0=Mixed, 1=Basic, 2=Traditional, 3=Modern, 4=HIO, 5=Short,
6=Long).

## Lobby chat

```
client → d N lobby<TAB>say<TAB>{text}
server → d K lobby<TAB>say<TAB>{text}<TAB>{senderNick}<TAB>{senderClan}
   (broadcast to OTHERS only — sender echoes locally)

client → d N lobby<TAB>sayp<TAB>{recipientNick}<TAB>{text}
server → d K lobby<TAB>sayp<TAB>{senderNick}<TAB>{text}
   (delivered to recipient only)
```

Game chat is symmetric:
```
client → d N game<TAB>say<TAB>{text}
server → d K game<TAB>say<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{text}
```

Newlines and tabs in chat text are stripped client-side (would break framing).

## Single-player game (training)

```
client → d N {lobby|lobbyselect}<TAB>cspt<TAB>{numTracks}<TAB>{trackType}<TAB>{water}
   (lobby = use this when already in lobby; lobbyselect = creates+joins
    in one step)

server → d K status<TAB>game
server → d K+1 game<TAB>gameinfo<TAB>{15 fields, see below}
server → d K+2 game<TAB>players                   (no other players → no fields)
server → d K+3 game<TAB>owninfo<TAB>{numIdx}<TAB>{nick}<TAB>{clan}
server → d K+4 game<TAB>start
server → d K+5 game<TAB>resetvoteskip
server → d K+6 game<TAB>starttrack<TAB>{playStatus}<TAB>{gameId}<TAB>{trackData}
```

`{trackData}` is the V1 networkSerialize body. Tab-separated lines:
```
V 1<TAB>A {author}<TAB>N {name}<TAB>T {map}<TAB>C {categories}<TAB>S {settings}
<TAB>I {plays},{strokes},{bestPar},{numBestPar}<TAB>B {bestPlayer},{bestEpochMs}
<TAB>R {r0},{r1},...,{r10}
```
The `B` line is omitted if `bestPar < 0`. The `C` and `S` lines are OUR port
extensions — Java doesn't include them. `S` carries the four-flag visibility
string (`mines/magnets/teleports/illusion-shadows`, plus the legacy 2-digit
player-range suffix); use `parseSettingsFlags` from `@minigolf/shared` to
decode the first four chars. Use `extractField(fields, "C ")` /
`extractField(fields, "S ")` on the client.

## Game info packet (15 fields)

```
game<TAB>gameinfo<TAB>{name}<TAB>{passworded(t/f)}<TAB>{gameId}<TAB>{numPlayers}
<TAB>{numTracks}<TAB>{trackType}<TAB>{maxStrokes}<TAB>{strokeTimeout}
<TAB>{waterEvent}<TAB>{collision}<TAB>{trackScoring}<TAB>{trackScoringEnd}<TAB>f
```

Field positions (0-indexed within the tab-split fields array, so `[0]=game`,
`[1]=gameinfo`):
- `[2]` name
- `[3]` passworded
- `[4]` gameId
- `[5]` numPlayers
- `[6]` numTracks
- `[7]` trackType
- `[8]` maxStrokes
- `[9]` strokeTimeout
- `[10]` waterEvent
- `[11]` collision
- `[12]` trackScoring
- `[13]` trackScoringEnd
- `[14]` "f"

## Multi-player game

Create:
```
client → d N lobby<TAB>cmpt<TAB>{name}<TAB>{password|-}<TAB>{perms=0}
        <TAB>{numPlayers}<TAB>{numTracks}<TAB>{trackType}<TAB>{maxStrokes}
        <TAB>{strokeTimeout=60}<TAB>{water}<TAB>{collision}
        <TAB>{trackScoring=0}<TAB>{trackScoringEnd=0}
```

Server processes via `LobbyMultiplayerHandler`, broadcasts
`lobby gamelist add <gameString>` to everyone in the lobby and adds the
creator to the new game.

Join:
```
client → d N lobby<TAB>jmpt<TAB>{gameId}[<TAB>{password}]
   (if password is wrong, server replies `error wrongpassword` and bumps
    the player back to the lobby)
```

When the game fills, server broadcasts `lobby gamelist remove <gameId>` and
sends `game start` + `game starttrack` to all players.

## Stroke flow (async, port-specific)

Initiating a stroke:
```
client → d N game<TAB>beginstroke<TAB>{ballCoords}<TAB>{mouseCoords}
   (client does NOT apply impulse — waits for the broadcast)
server → d K game<TAB>beginstroke<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{ballCoords}<TAB>{mouseCoords}<TAB>{seed}
   (broadcast to ALL players including the shooter; seed is the server-assigned
    32-bit per-stroke seed)
```

`ballCoords` and `mouseCoords` are base-36 4-character encodings of
`x * 1500 + y * 4 + mode`. The `mode` field carries the right-click
shooting mode (0 = normal, 1 = reverse 180°, 2 = 90° clockwise,
3 = 90° counter-clockwise) on `mouseCoords`, mirroring the original
GameCanvas.shootingMode. `ballCoords` always uses mode 0.

When the ball stops (any reason — at rest, in hole, on water/acid):
```
client → d N game<TAB>endstroke<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{playStatusString}
   (only the shooter sends this; playStatus is one char per player —
    't' = in hole, 'p' = forfeited/passed, 'f' = still playing)
server → d K game<TAB>endstroke<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{strokesThisTrack}<TAB>{status: t|p|f}
   (broadcast to ALL — server may flip 'f' to 'p' if the player just hit the
    stroke cap; the strokes count is authoritative)
```

Forfeit:
```
client → d N game<TAB>forfeit
server → d K game<TAB>endstroke<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{maxStrokes}<TAB>p
```

When all players are non-`f`, server advances:
```
server → d K game<TAB>resetvoteskip
server → d K+1 game<TAB>starttrack<TAB>{playStatus}<TAB>{gameId}<TAB>{trackData}
   (a new per-stroke seed counter starts here too)
```

When the last track is done:
```
server → d K game<TAB>end[<TAB>{p0Result}<TAB>{p1Result}...]
   (1 = winner, 0 = draw, -1 = loser; results omitted in single-player)
```

## Live aim preview (cursor stream — port-specific)

Loss-tolerant 15 Hz cursor broadcast for spectator-flavoured UX: every player
sees every other player's aim line in real time while they're lining up a
shot. Not used for physics — purely cosmetic.

```
client → d N game<TAB>cursor<TAB>{x}<TAB>{y}[<TAB>{shootingMode}]
   (sent only while OUR ball is at rest, throttled to ≤15 Hz, suppressed if
    cursor moved <2 px since the last send; sent immediately on shootingMode
    change so peers see right-click rotation even if the cursor is stationary)
server → d K game<TAB>cursor<TAB>{playerId}<TAB>{x}<TAB>{y}[<TAB>{shootingMode}]
   (server stamps the sender's playerId and forwards to every OTHER player in
    the game — sender doesn't get an echo. The shootingMode field is relayed
    verbatim when present and omitted when absent — back-compat with clients
    that don't track the right-click cycle)
```

`{x}` and `{y}` are integer canvas pixel coordinates (0..735, 0..375).
`{shootingMode}` is `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3` (Java GameCanvas.shootingMode):
0 = normal, 1 = reverse 180°, 2 = 90° clockwise, 3 = 90° counter-clockwise.
Watcher renders the peer's aim line in the same rotated direction the peer
sees on their own screen. The client only renders a peer's cursor as an aim
line when the peer's ball is at rest and the peer hasn't holed-in / forfeited.
Cursor state is cleared on `starttrack` so the previous hole's last cursor
never leaks into the next.

## Heartbeat

Server side:
- If no inbound for 15s → send `c ping`.
- If no inbound for 60s → close with reason "idle-timeout".

Client side:
- Always reply pong to inbound `c ping` (auto-handled in `Connection`).
- Proactive `c ping` every 15s regardless. This is what keeps a backgrounded
  browser tab from being timed out (Chrome throttles JS in background tabs;
  the auto-pong might miss the deadline; the proactive ping has more slack).

## Reconnect after network blip

The connect-handshake `c crt 250` advertises a 250-second window during
which a disconnected player can reattach by opening a fresh WebSocket and
sending `c old <savedId>` instead of `c new`. Server-side, this is a
faithful port of Java's `ReconnectHandler`.

Sequence:
```
(network blip — client's WS dies, code 1006 / wasClean=false)

(server) handleDisconnect: defers full cleanup by 250s if player.game === null;
         player record stays in the lobby (peers' user lists unchanged).
         Mid-game disconnects bypass grace and forfeit immediately —
         peers are otherwise stuck waiting for endstroke.

(client) opens fresh WS — server sends usual banner:
         h 1
         c crt 250
         c ctr

(client) sends      c old <savedId>
(server) replies    c rcok        ← grace was active; new socket adopted
              -- or c rcf         ← unknown id, grace expired, or mid-game
```

Both directions reset their DATA seq counter to 0 on `c rcok`. The
implementation does NOT replay packets sent during the dead window —
anything the server pushed while the WS was down is simply lost (e.g.
peer chat). This matches what the original Java client effectively did
(its retain-seq protocol tripped its own gap-detection on any peer
broadcast during the gap).

Client-side retry: 10 attempts, 3-second interval (~30s total budget).
Capped well under the server's 250s window so we surface failure
quickly when the network is genuinely down rather than thrashing.
On exhaustion or `c rcf` the client emits `reconnect-failed` and shows
"Reconnect failed — please refresh." in the error banner.

The `c old`/`c rcok`/`c rcf` packets bypass DATA seq tracking (they're
COMMAND packets) and are intercepted by `Connection.handleLine` while in
reconnect mode — panels never see them. Files: `port/server/src/server.ts`
(`handleReconnect`), `port/server/src/packet-handlers.ts` (`old` handler),
`port/web/src/connection.ts` (reconnect mode + `c old <savedId>` driver),
`port/web/src/app.ts` (`reconnecting`/`reconnected`/`reconnect-failed`
banner).

## Quitting / leaving

```
client → d N game<TAB>back        (in-game: leave to lobby)
server → d K status<TAB>lobby<TAB>{type}    (re-routes via app.setPanel)
```

`back` from the LAST player in a game also triggers `lobby gamelist remove
<gameId>` for everyone in that lobby.
